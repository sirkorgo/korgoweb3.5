**Heyo! Sirkorgo here.**

Welcome to the new sirkorgo.com!
Site changelogs and roadmaps will be posted here, along with other site information.

***October 12, 2025***
<br>
Right now, the site is moderately stable, with a few quirks here and there, along with a few leftover assets from Blogger. Things like the sirkorgo sticker are temporary as of now, and I plan to replace it in the future.

Chat should be reopening in a few days, and I'll be retheming the guestbook to fit the site.
Also, I'll post a video of how this site works (as requested by my computer science teacher) in a little bit.

So yeah! have fun!

That's all from me, see ya!
