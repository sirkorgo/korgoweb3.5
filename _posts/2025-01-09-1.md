Heyo! Sirkorgo here.

I recently purchased an iPod nano 3rd generation, as its the most similar to the classic line of iPods but with a small form factor. I personally prefer this model, as it was the iPod I owned when I was younger, which I sadly no longer have.

But as you probably know, I'm obsessed with tech from the 2000's. I find their qualities really interesting and charming, in a way.

The iPod was revolutionary for its time, as it could hold so many songs in such a form factor, unlike its competition, from Samsung and Creative which didn't even come close.

A big staple of the 2000's were single-purpose technology. What this means is that instead of having a phone for music, internet, gaming, email, photos, and more, you had multiple devices for different things. At the time, your phone was used for calling and texting, a camera for taking pictures, and an MP3 Player for music.

And in that time period, the most popular MP3 player *had* to be the iPod.

Now that its 2025, everybody just uses their phones for everyday usage. But even though iPods have gone irrelevant with smartphones, people *still* use them to this day.

But *why?*

Well, there's a couple reasons. The current state of digital media, and trying to stay focused.

## What's the state of digital media?

Right now, you don't OWN your digital media. You just own a license to download it and play it. Which means your music provider can just... get rid of your license that you paid for just with one click.

The same applies to subscription based streaming services. You don't own anything. The providers can just pull the plug on your favorite song, album, or artist!

A lot of people hate this, but don't want to deal with the hassle of CDs or cassettes. Which is where the iPod comes in. You can just rip your CDs and or your cassettes onto it and carry around your entire collection with you.

Personally, I like to buy songs and albums on Bandcamp, and then save them to my local iTunes Library to play on my iPod.

## Trying to focus with modern day tech.

It's pretty hard to focus on *anything* really because of the amounts of notifications and social medias there are. I like listening to music while I work, but I get easily distracted by apps like instagram and tiktok (rip). The iPod kind of solves that, since its not trying to get your attention. It just... plays music.

But the iPod can't stream music, which is where purchasing songs comes in.

Another reason is obviously nostalgia, but the iPod still provides *some* functionality. But anyways, iPods are still really cool in 2025.

That's all from me! See ya.
