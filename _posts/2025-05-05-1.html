<p>Heyo! Sirkorgo here.</p>

<p>The Nintendo 3DS arguably has one of the biggest Homebrew communities out there, with the first exploit being discovered just one year after its release date in 2011. But now that it's been 14 years of the 3DS's release date, the modding community has definitely come a long way.</p>

<h2>What Is Homebrew?</h2>

<p>But wait, what IS Homebrew?</p>

<p>Homebrew, or Homebrewing is basically another word for modding and hacking a system to run your own code and programs. Homebrew communities usually consist of some pretty cool and passionate developers.</p>

<h2>Installing Homebrew</h2>

<p>If you're gonna run homebrew on your Nintendo 3DS, you obviously need to mod it to run homebrew. Don't worry it's really easy, and all you'll need is a computer. The steps are pretty simple. Just drag some things to your SD Card, run some apps, press some buttons, and you should be good! But in all seriousness, its pretty easy to mess up a 3DS while homebrewing it. I suggest reading the guide on <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/">https://3ds.hacks.guide</a>, as it will always be the most up to date.</p>

<h2>Starter Things you NEED to do</h2>

<p>You just homebrewed your 3DS, great! Now what? Well there's A LOT you can do to a modded 3DS. Personally, these are the things I did first with my 3DS. First things first. FBI Manager and Universal Updater. FBI is a lightweight but advanced file manager for the 3DS.</p>

<p>And the main thing is that it can install games, and remotely connect to your computer.</p>

<p>Which is nice for new 3DS users, as the SD Card is locked up behind it's backplate, which requires a screwdriver to get to (thanks nintendo &gt;:( Universal Updater is similar to that as well, but its basically the eShop for Homebrew software.</p>

<p>You can easily install software without a computer, which is how I installed most of my software.</p>

<p>Another necessity Pretendo Network. Basically, its a service that revives online services for your 3DS. I'll get more into that later.</p>

<h2>Anemone Theme Manager</h2>

<p>Apart from the basic utilites that the homebrew community offers, The Anemone Theme Manager offers great customization for your 3DS. Anemone allows for you to download custom themes on your 3DS from a website called the Theme Plaza! You can also make your own too (like I did) and apply it to your 3DS! I personally love this, since having myself on the home screen, or anything you want really, is really freaking cool.</p>

<h2>CTGP 7</h2>

<p>And speaking of customization, there's CTGP 7 for Mario Kart 7. I personally don't play CTGP 7 that often, but let me tell you, this modpack is awesome. You can do pretty much anything with it (as long as you know how, obviously). From what I know, you can make custom maps, install game improvements, and add characters and custom cars. Just imagine Peter Griffin driving a toy car in Green Hill Zone.</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<h2>Pretendo Network</h2>

<p>Another great homebrew project is Pretendo Network! Like I said earlier, Pretendo Network helps revive the online services for the 3DS! Some of which include online play, friends list, and personal two favorites, Miiverse and StreetPass Relay!</p>

<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhRtO3lm9yDCcKX9onI-jxWmG3OqMeHC8G5yx6zx7xevX9teViG6h-8EN7NCY5TXPVmN8ztPNN-MDM_JG2TJkzQWuNc_ieYOr0Vs6n602TzkV4cHZyo9t-LjJHhg5VCQPTJLkgkjCE7W8aIu4QvsrlnredG8dVfOTlCS2EbVSnEL1IiI6inhBU3eL7SKbA" width="320" height="201" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;" alt="Pretendo Network">

<p>(Widget) Woah, wait a minute, what's Streetpass Relay?</p>

<p>(sirkorgo) Well I'm glad you asked, Widget!</p>

<p>Streetpass Relay was a feature where you could get streetpasses through Nintendo Zone, but the people at Pretendo reworked it so that you can get Streetpasses over the internet with people in your friends list, or people you play with online!</p>

<p>Anyways, the guys at Pretendo are doing really good work and are really making the 3DS feel alive. It's pretty easy to install, and you can follow the guide on their website at pretendo.network</p>

<h2>NetPass (excluded from video)</h2>

<p>Another software aiming to revive dead services is NetPass! Similar to Streetpass Relay, NetPass connects you to a server where you can exchange streetpasses! This is considerably useful, since adding friends on the 3DS is somewhat of a tedious task, and getting streetpasses in person is out of the question.</p>

<p>Some people, like my friend mjv2011, don't want to use this since it's pretty much cheating going outside, and I respect that.</p>

<h2>Emulation</h2>

<p>Now, a great quality about 3DS is that it's amazing at emulation. From my testing, 3DSes run so many retro games as if they were intended to run on the 3DS. (well most of them ARE intended to, because of Virtual Console) and there are MANY ways to play those retro games using Homebrew. My go-to is Retro Arch, as it tends to be the "all in one" emulator. But the 3DS starts to lag more with the N64 and PS1, as I guess they're pretty hard to emulate.</p>

<p>Something interesting about the 3DS is that it can actually natively play GBA games, as it's built off of the original Nintendo DS, which is why GBA games run so well.</p>

<p>But overall, the 3DS is nice place to store your retro game library and play them.</p>

<h2>Official Software &amp; Content</h2>

<p>Oh, and speaking of Nintendo games, Homebrew can be a real lifesaver with your games library. With Checkpoint, another great homebrew utility, you can backup your game's save data! This is useful for physical games, as you never know when your save data suddenly gets corrupted.</p>

<p>And there's um.. the salty seven seas (pirating). It's surprisingly easy to just download totally legitimate content for the 3DS through the hShop. It's entirely up to you if you're fine with pirating, but I'm not. I like having a game library that I bought that just isn't pirated of off someone else's copy of the game. But if a game has a ridiculous price (like Rhythm Heaven Fever for the Wii) I'd pirate it.</p>

<p>But overall, right now is the best time to mod your 3DS, as you'll be able to get so much more out of it, and use it as if it was still 2015. And I only covered the tip of the iceberg of 3DS modding, as theres a lot more to it like amiibo hacking, rom hacks for games, and even a web server host for the 3DS. Crazy right?</p>

<p>That's all from me! See ya.</p>
